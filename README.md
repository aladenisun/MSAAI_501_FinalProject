# Misinformation Detection: Detecting Fake News and AI-Generated Content (MSAAI_501_FinalProject)

This project investigates whether machine learning and deep learning techniques can accurately classify news articles as Real or Fake and further identify whether the content was written by a Human or generated by AI. With the rapid spread of misinformation online and the rise of generative AI tools, distinguishing authentic news from synthetic or misleading content has become increasingly challenging. Our work aims to build a multi-label classification system that not only detects misinformation but also analyzes broader patterns in how and when it spreads.

Using two publicly available Kaggle datasets, the system analyzes textual content, linguistic features, writing styles, contextual cues, and metadata to perform classification. The project also explores temporal and geographical trends to understand when misinformation spikes and whether certain regions exhibit higher frequencies of misleading or AI-generated news.

This repository contains the full workflow for the project, including dataset preparation, text preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization of misinformation trends.

## Objectives
The project aims to:
- Classify news text as Real or Fake using machine learning and deep learning models
- Distinguish AI-Generated content from Human-written content
- Analyze linguistic and stylistic features that commonly appear in fake or AI-generated news
- Identify monthly patterns using time-series analysis to examine misinformation spikes during events or holidays
- Compare misinformation prevalence between U.S. and international sources
- Provide model interpretability through feature insights and confidence scores

## Methods and Techniques
### Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression (baseline classifier)
### Deep Learning Models
- LSTM (sequential language modeling)
- BERT (transformer-based contextual model)
### Techniques Applied
- NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- TF-IDF vectorization for classical ML models
- Embeddings for deep learning models
- Model comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Time-series and regional trend exploration

## Expected System Outputs
Given a news article (title + body), the system returns:
- Real / Fake classification with confidence scores
- AI-Generated / Human-Written classification with confidence scores
- Key linguistic indicators that influenced predictions
- Trend visualizations:
  -  Misinformation by month
  -  AI-generated misinformation frequency
  - US. vs International comparisons
